# AOS Architecture

AOS (Agentic Operating System) is a self-hosted AI agent runtime on a Mac Mini. It provides persistent services, a messaging bridge, task tracking, and self-healing infrastructure so Claude-based agents can act continuously — not just during a single chat session.

## How Updates Work

```
aos update
  └── git pull ~/project/aos → ~/aos       (pull latest framework)
  └── reconcile runner                     (19 health checks, auto-fix)
  └── migrate                              (run any pending data migrations)
  └── sync LaunchAgents                    (register new/changed plists)
  └── restart changed services             (graceful restart only what changed)
```

## How Sessions Work

```
Claude Code session opens
  └── SessionStart hook → inject_context.py
        reads active tasks, current thread, handoff notes
        injects them into the system prompt

  agent works — reads vault, runs tools, builds things

Claude Code session closes
  └── SessionEnd hook → session_close.py
        if tasks are in-progress: prompts agent to write handoff
        logs session summary to ~/.aos/logs/
```

## Key Commands

```bash
aos update                                      # Pull, reconcile, sync, restart
aos self-test                                   # Run smoke tests against all services
python3 ~/aos/core/work/cli.py add "Title"      # Create a task
python3 ~/aos/core/work/cli.py done "fuzzy"     # Complete a task
python3 ~/aos/core/work/cli.py list             # List active tasks
python3 ~/aos/core/work/cli.py handoff <id> ... # Write handoff before ending session
qmd query "<topic>"                             # Search vault + AOS docs
agent-secret get <key>                          # Read a secret from Keychain
```
