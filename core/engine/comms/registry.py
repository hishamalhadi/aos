"""Communication channel registry.

Reads from the integrations registry (core/infra/integrations/registry.yaml) to
discover which communication channels are active. No separate comms config —
the integrations registry is the single source of truth.

    from core.comms.registry import get_active_channels, load_adapters

    # What comms integrations are available?
    channels = get_active_channels()

    # Load adapter instances for all active channels
    adapters = load_adapters()
