"""People Intelligence system consumer.

Subscribes to the system bus for events from any domain that involve
person interactions. Currently handles comms events; future domains
(schedule, email) add handlers here.

This consumer bridges the system bus to the existing People Intelligence
DB. It doesn't duplicate the comms-level consumer's message processing —
instead it reacts to higher-level domain events.

Event types handled:
    comms.message_sent     — operator sent a message (log outbound interaction)
    comms.messages_polled  — messages received (logged by comms consumer already,
                             but system consumer tracks the signal)
    schedule.*             — future: calendar events as interactions
